***Index 0*** is **the first release by Indexical**. The record contains new
pieces for two violins, string quartet, solo piano, and fixed-media
electronics, recorded in August 2012 and May 2013 in Brooklyn and New York
City. The project was born out of a desire to provide context and support for
one another's work, and was funded through pooled resources and a successful
[Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1108228312/index-0-a-double-lp-of-new-experimental-music) campaign.

Recorded by Alexis Berthelot at Studio G and Benzaquen Hall, DiMenna Center for
Classical Music. Edited and mixed by Beau Sievers at the Bregman Music and
Audio Research Studio. Mastered by Joe Branciforte at Greyfade Studios.

Art by Joanne K. Cheung. Design by Joanne K. Cheung and Indexical.
