***Index 0***, **the first release by Indexical**, is now in print as a
double-LP set and digital download. The record contains new pieces for two
violins, string quartet, solo piano, and fixed-media electronics, recorded in
August 2012 and May 2013 in Brooklyn and New York City. The project was born
out of a desire to provide context and support for one another's work, and was
funded through pooled resources and a successful
[Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1108228312/index-0-a-double-lp-of-new-experimental-music) campaign.
