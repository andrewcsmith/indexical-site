Indexical presents Los Angeles composer **Casey Anderson** in a performance of “TALK
RADIO (an opera),” for performers and handheld radios. Casey Anderson will also
direct performances of “Trio (White on White)” and “She Was a Visitor,” by
avant-garde composer Robert Ashley, who created “opera for television” with his
1983 serialized opera Perfect Lives. Finally, Santa Cruz locals David Kant and
Andrew C. Smith will round out the night with a psychedelic drone set of
slowed-down speech, electronics, saxophone, and electric piano, drawn from "The
Park," from Robert Ashley's *Perfect Lives*.

All ages are welcome to attend a performance workshop at 4 pm on Saturday, July
11, and to join the performance later that evening as the “chorus” for “She Was
a Visitor.”
