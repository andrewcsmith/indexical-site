**The Happy Valley Band is the Great American Songbook heard through the ear of a
machine**. It is a cover band led by a computer, futilely attempting to notate
every sound it hears in classic pop songs. Through a process of machine
listening, original recordings are unmixed into their individual instruments,
interpreted into musical notation, and performed live. The result is a
hyper-complex and microtonal deconstruction of the song, with the
machine-mediated score accompanying the original voices of popular music icons
such as Elvis, James Brown, and Patsy Cline.

Taking after pioneering audio plunderer John Oswald, the Happy Valley Band
recontextualizes the voices of popular music through modern digital sound
analysis. Making a Happy Valley Band arrangement is a process of translation
between machine analysis and human performance. Artifacts of the process of
audio separation and transcription produce complex and overly specific notation,
and the ensemble has developed a unique performance practice in response to the
idiosyncratic scores.

Directed by bandleader / composer David Kant, the Happy Valley Band is a
seven-piece band with Alexander Dupuis (guitar), Beau Sievers (drums), Andrew
Smith (piano), Mustafa Walker (bass), Conrad Harris (violin), Pauline Kim Harris
(violin), and David Kant (saxophone), plus frequent special guests. The Happy
Valley Band is performing west coast concert dates this spring, and will release
a debut album this fall, The World Does Not Need More Songs, on Indexical.
