S&eacute;verine Ballon's (cello) work as a performer focuses on regular performance of
key works of the cello repertoire and numerous direct collaborations with
composers. Her research as improviser has helped her to extend the sonic and
technical resources of her instrument. She has worked with such composers as
Helmut Lachenmann, Liza Lim, Mauro Lanza and Rebecca Saunders. Her work crosses
the centuries from gut strings to electronics, over a wide range of aesthetics
from Feldman to Ferneyhough. She is a member of Elision ensemble (Australia) and
Multilatérale (Paris). 

Andrew C. Smith (piano) is a composer and keyboardist living in Santa Cruz,
California. His music often involves just intonation tunings, repetition, and
connections with language. He co-organizes the composer-run record label and
concert producer Indexical. 

Indexical is a composer-run experimental music record label and concert producer
organized by David Kant, Beau Sievers, and Andrew C. Smith, and based in Santa
Cruz.
