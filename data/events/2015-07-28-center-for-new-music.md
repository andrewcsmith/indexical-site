key works of the cello repertoire and numerous direct collaborations with

technical resources of her instrument. She has worked with such composers as
Helmut Lachenmann, Liza Lim, Mauro Lanza and Rebecca Saunders. Her work crosses
the centuries from gut strings to electronics, over a wide range of aesthetics
from Feldman to Ferneyhough. She is a member of Elision ensemble (Australia) and
Multilatérale (Paris).
