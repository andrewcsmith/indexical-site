Join us at Littlefield NYC for a party to celebrate the launch of our new record
label and release of the first record: *Index 0*. Violin duo **String Noise**
(Conrad Harris & Pauline Kim Harris) will headline the show, warmed up by **The
Happy Valley Band** and **David Kant**, and cooled down with the microwaved
dance duo **Gravies and the Main Dish Sauce**.
